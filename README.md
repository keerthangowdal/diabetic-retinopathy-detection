# 🧠 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN

This is a web-based application for detecting **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** — a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes — using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Users can upload retinal images and receive real-time predictions from a trained deep learning model.

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness in diabetic patients. Early detection plays a crucial role in preventing permanent vision damage. This project offers an automated screening system that analyzes retinal fundus images and classifies them for signs of retinopathy. It is built to support healthcare professionals with a quick and efficient diagnostic tool.
